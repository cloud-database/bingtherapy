              Online therapy is growing, in no small part due to our new way of being in the world, but even before everything went haywire, it was gaining traction. BingTherapy also provides free service for clients who have been financially impacted by the outbreak (e.g. layoff or loss of income). For new clients, the company is offering financial aid that can cover up to 50% of the counseling cost. Counselors will still be paid but BingTherapy will subsidize the loss.

                  (depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder etc.)

                  Teletherapy, a form of telehealth, offers online counseling with licensed therapists via phone, webcam, email or text message. Also known as telepsychology, telemental health or telepractice, 
                  this service has been around for more than 20 years, originally utilized by the military to treat veterans and serve patients in rural areas. And now the convenient way to access mental health is catching on with millennials.

                  so they can truly make a decision based on rightness of fit.

                After you sign up, we will pair you to an available counselor or therapist who fits your objectives, preferences, and the type of issues you are dealing with. Different counselors have different approaches and areas of focus, so it's important to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you. We have found that we are able to provide a successful pairing most of the time; however, if you start the process and you feel your counselor isn't a good fit for you, you may elect to be matched to a different counselor.

              <p>
                The professionals who work through BingTherapy are licensed and credentialed therapists who were certified by their state's board to provide therapy and counseling. However, while the service may have similar benefits, it's not capable of substituting for traditional face-to-face therapy in every case. Please note that your provider won't be able to make any official diagnosis, to fulfill any court order or prescribe medication.

                This process can take a few hours or a few days, depending on counselor availability. Don't worry, your subscription period starts when you are paired with a counselor or had your first conversation with your therapist / counselor.

                You can also have a video session with your counselor where you see each other and talk with each other in a virtual face-to-face setting (similar to Skype, Zoom, Google). To talk with your counselor via video, you will need to schedule a time with your counselor and log in to your counseling room at that time. Your counselor will then prompt you to start the video session. After you confirm, you will immediately begin video chatting with your counselor.

                Your membership payments will be charged to a credit card or PayPal on a recurring basis. If you accomplish your goals or if you find online counseling with BingTherapy to no longer be helpful for any reason, you can simply cancel the subscription.
